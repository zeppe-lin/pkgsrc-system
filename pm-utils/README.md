README pm-utils

NOTES
=====

Some hardware modules can cause issues when suspending.  To unload these
modules, create a file named "default" in `/etc/pm/config.d`:

```sh
SUSPEND_MODULES="button uhci_hcd ehci_hcd iwl3945"
```


CONFIGURATION
=============

When pm-utils are called, hooks are called from `/usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d`.
Additional, user-created hooks can be placed in `/etc/pm/sleep.d`.  These hooks
will take precedence over those in `/usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d`.  For example:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
case $1 in
suspend)  /etc/rc.d/wifi stop         ;;
 resume)  /etc/rc.d/wifi start        ;;
      *)  echo "Something is broken"  ;;
esac
```

Place these commands as "66dummy" (or similar).  To allow this file to run
during suspend:

```sh
sudo chmod +x /etc/pm/sleep.d/66dummy
```

To suspend to disk, you must append the swap partition in `/etc/default/grub`:

```sh
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="resume=/dev/zpln/swap"
```

For troubleshooting, log files should be available in `/var/log`.

If a hook is causing issues, create an empty equivalent in `/etc/pm/sleep.d/`:

```sh
sudo touch /etc/pm/sleep.d/55NetworkManager
```


KERNEL CONFIGURATION
====================

If needed, enable the following options in the kernel configuration and
recompile the kernel:

```
Power management and ACPI options --->
  <*> Suspend to RAM and standby
      [CONFIG_SUSPEND]
  <*> Hibernation (aka 'suspend to disk')
      [CONFIG_HIBERNATION]
```

Suspend to RAM allows the system to enter sleep states in which main memory is
powered and thus its contents are preserved.  The method cuts power to most
parts of the machine aside from the RAM.  Because of the large power savings,
it is advisable for laptops to automatically enter this mode when the computer
is running on batteries and the lid is closed (or the user is inactive for
some time).

Suspend to disk (Hibernation) saves the machine's state into swap space and
completely powers off the machine.  When the machine is powered on, the state
is restored.  Until then, there is zero power consumption.  Suspend to RAM and
hibernation are normally appropriate for portable devices such as laptops, but
can be used on workstations.  The capability is not really appropriate for
servers.

To use hibernation, the kernel parameter

```
resume=/dev/<swap_partition>
```

has to be used on the kernel command line (in `grub.cfg`).  The swap partition
should be at least the size of the physical RAM on the system.
