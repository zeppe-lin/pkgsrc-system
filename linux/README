UPGRADE
	Since the upgrade will remove the current working kernel and its
	modules, you may like to lock the Linux package and not upgrade it
	during regular system upgrades.  If you plan not to turn off the
	computer for a long time, it is better to do this and update the
	kernel separately through pkgman-update(8) at a time that suits you.
	See pkgman-lock(8) for more information about package locking.
