README lighttpd


POST-INSTALL
============

lighttpd runs as a different user ('lighttpd') by default for security
reasons.  Do the following after installing the package:

	sudo useradd -s /bin/false lighttpd
	sudo groupadd lighttpd
	sudo touch /var/www/logs/access_log
	sudo touch /var/www/logs/error_log
	sudo chown lighttpd:lighttpd /var/www/logs/*

If you wish to enable SSL support, uncomment the relevant lines in
/etc/lighttpd.conf and generate a self-signed certificate:

	sudo openssl req -new -x509              \
	    -keyout /etc/ssl/certs/lighttpd.pem  \
	    -out    /etc/ssl/certs/lighttpd.pem  \
	    -days 365 -nodes


PRECAUTION
==========

As of lighttpd 1.4.23 spawn-fcgi was removed and is now provided as a separate
project at:
http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/spawn-fcgi
