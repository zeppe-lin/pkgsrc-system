KERNEL CONFIGURATION

	In a manual kernel setup is needed to include the following necessary
	features (statically or as modules):

	General setup --->
	  [*] Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support
              CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y

	Device Drivers --->
	  Generic Driver Options --->
	    [*] Maintain a devtmpfs filesystem to mount at /dev
	        CONFIG_DEVTMPFS=y

	To use mkinitramfs with encrypted root is needed to include the
	following features too:

	Device Drivers --->
	  Multiple devices driver support (RAID and LVM) --->
	    [*] Device mapper support
	    [*] Crypt target support

	Cryptographic API --->
	  <*> XTS support
	  <*> SHA224 and SHA256 digest algorithm
	  <*> AES cipher algorithms
	  <*> AES cipher algorithms (x86_64)
	  <*> User-space interface for hash algorithms
	  <*> User-space interface for symmetric key cipher algorithms

USAGE

	1) Edit /etc/mkinitramfs/config file conform your needs.  See
	mkinitramfs.config(5) for more information.  Next, run the following
	command to generate the initramfs image:

		# mkinitramfs -o "/boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img"

	2) Update your bootloader configuration file, and specify the
	previously created initramfs image as initrd option argument:

		initrd /initramfs-${version}.img

	In case of GRUB, grub-mkconfig will automatically make it by running:

		# grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

	3) Reboot.

End of file.
