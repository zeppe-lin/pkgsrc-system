POST-INSTALL
============

Edit monitrc control file as you need (/etc/monitrc).

Also, monit can run and be controlled from init.
If monit should crash, init will re-spawn a new monit process.
To setup monit to run from init, you can use the 'set init' statement
in monitrc and then edit your /etc/inittab as:

	# Run monit in standard run-levels
	mo:2345:respawn:/usr/bin/monit -Ic /etc/monitrc
