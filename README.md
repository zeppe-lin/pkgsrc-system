OVERVIEW
--------
This directory contains system pkgsrc collection.  This collection
contains build scripts and files for the packages required for minimal
Zeppe-Lin installation on real hardware: boot loader, filesystem
utilities, hw-monitors, servers, and so on.  Packages in this
collection depends **only** on the core pkgsrc collection.

This distribution was originally forked from CRUX ports as of version
3.6 and rewritten in POSIX sh(1p).  Also, the Zeppe-Lin has its own
criteria for what packages should be in system collection.
