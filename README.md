OVERVIEW
--------
This directory contains **system** pkgsrc collection: build scripts
and files for the packages required for minimal installation on real
hardware (e.g. boot loader, filesystem utilities, hw-monitors, etc)
and/or packages required for servers.

Packages in this collection must depend **only** on **core** pkgsrc
collection.

This distribution was originally forked from CRUX ports as of version
3.6 and rewritten in POSIX sh(1p).
