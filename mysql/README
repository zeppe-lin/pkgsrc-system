README mysql

POST-INSTALL

	1. Build the system database in /var/lib/mysql:

		mysql_install_db
	
	2. Add new privileges and features to the MySQL privilege tables if
	you have databases created with older versions of mysql:

		mysql_upgrade
	
	3. Set a password for the mysql root user:

		mysqladmin -u root password <mysql_root_password>

PRECAUTION

	1. With the default configuration networking support for mysql is
	disabled, meaning the mysql daemon is accessable from localhost only.
	To add networking support comment out the 'skip-networking' line in
	/etc/my.cnf.

	2. If you upgrade from mysql 5.6.x you must recompile the other
	packages on your system that are linked against the mysql client
	libraries (libmysqlclient).  To obtain such a list of packages for
	your system, you may use the command 'pkgman rdep mysql' or use
	revdep(1).
